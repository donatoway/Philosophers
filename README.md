# Philosophers 
- is a project that introduces basics of multi-threaded processes and parallelism

# What mean Thread?
- A thread can be thought of as a procedure that works in parallel with others
procedure within a process. To run in parallel with the rest of the process, a thread must have
data structures ie its own execution environment, to realize
your own flow of control. Each procedure to be performed in parallel will be a thread.
